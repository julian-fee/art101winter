		<h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>
		<p class="idea">The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on my computer and add to the index.html file we will be using as our homepage for the course. </p>
		<h2>Difficulties I encountered:</h2>
		<p>I found it difficult to link images within the HTML code. There is just a lot of detail to remember when you are typing out code. I found it easier to have an old code of mine up next to the one I am working on so I can copy what I did for a smoother and less irritating result. </p>
		<p>I also found the formatting of unordered lists to be a bit difficult, especially making themlinks to another file, however pulling up "w3schools" I found that I could easily figure out what to do.</p>
		<h2>Results of Lab3:</h2>
		<p>The results of Lab3 were similar to that of Lab1 where we played around with HTML on our "index.html" file. A basic webpage with no CSS added for aesthetic.</p>
		<p>Here is the file structure that I created for Art101:</p>

		<h3>Screenshots of Lab3:</h3>

		<sub>Webpage index.html code</sub>
		<img class="centerimage" src="img/lab3_task2_2.jpg" width="500px"</img>
		<sub>The result of the index.html code</sub>
		<img class="centerimage" src="img/lab3_task3_1.jpg" width="500px"</img>
		<sub>The HTML for Lab 3</sub>
