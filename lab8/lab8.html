    <h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>I had several uncaught syntax errors within the frst run of my code on the console. I had a mispelling within the "thirdThing" function which caused several issues. </p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>My Slack app has given me several issues and I did not get the notification that my group was meeting today for the lab. Due to this, I am doing it on my own.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>Once I caught my errors, the code did not show any error within the console.</p>
