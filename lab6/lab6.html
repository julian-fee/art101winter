	<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p> This lab was to help us learn and practice how to code arrays and objects,
			both in an Atom file and in a web browser console. We were able to experiement
			with them and then put our final results onto this webpage.</p>

	<h2>Problems</h2>
	  <p> We had some issues corectly using console.log in Task 1 to print out
			  myTransport and myMainRide but we figured out we just had to change our
				spacing.</P>

	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>You're looking at the page we created. And down below is the program execution:</p>
