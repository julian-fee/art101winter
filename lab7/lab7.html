      <h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
      <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>The idea of this lab is to practice creating a function that takes user input
          and manipulates a string.
      <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>We had several issues with this lab starting with an error message regarding the 'split' function.
           The web prompt was showing up twice and if we pressed cancel on the second time, it would give an error message. </p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
        <p> The issue was that we had linked our js files twice within the html. Once we found this it worked perfectly. </p>



      <h2>Script Output</h2>
      <script src="js/lab7.js"></script>
        </div>
