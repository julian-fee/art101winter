      <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>This lab was one of the most difficult yet. There were very minimal instructions to help us through the lab. It is also due on the same date as our Paper Prototype Project.</p>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>We have had several issues with this lab. There was a lot of confusion with Task 2. There were a lot of syntax errors that prevented us from moving at an efficient pace. The code that was copied from Lab7 that previously ran with no errors did not work for this lab. We got the error "Uncaught TypeError: userName.split is not a function at nameSorter (lab10.js:14) at lab10.js:41" so many times despite changing both the HTML and JS many times that it was decided that we could not move any farther with this lab.</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>This is an intro course so we know there is a lot to learn, but 3 programming languages in an intro to Art course is a lot to handle. We have decided that in order to do these labs (especially that there are 2 due every week) that we need more examples/screenshots so it doesn't take up all of our day when some of us are in 3 other courses along with this one. We have also discussed that this class requires us to meet 8 times a week, over an hour everytime that this class should be 7 units; not 5. </p>
