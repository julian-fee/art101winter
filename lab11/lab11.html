      <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>The idea of this lab was to practice and experiment with jQuery.
        We are meant to create three buttons under each heading below with text
        attatched. Finally, the buttons must do something and toggle a CSS change.</p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>We had a few problems with this lab, the first being not knowing really
        where to start. We were able to link jQuery and use its syntax to find the
        elements we needed; however we got stuck when trying to use the toggleClass
        method. We found the lab instructions a little unclear, but once we got some
        from the TAs, we were able to complete the lab.</p>

    <div id="results">
      <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Click on each button to see what it does. As a bonus, we designated a different
        class toggle for each button!</p>
