		<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables<h1>

		<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p> The idea of this lab was to practice creating variables, both in the console on a browser,
			and within Atom. </p>

		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p> We had a lot of issues with the JavaScript appearing on the website. We copied and pasted the code from the console,
			but the document type content was not showing up. We ended up just retyping all of the code, and it worked! We had to
			play around with changing different things within our code to see what the issue was, and we used the Inspect window
			to help us as well. </p>

		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> This page is the index.html file that we created. Here is the program extension:</p>
