				<h1> Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem Solving. </h1>
					<h2> Challenges: </h2>
						<p>Lab 4 was a little bit confusing from the start. Althought I had previously taken Javascript before I was having a hard time figuring out what exactly we should be doing.
							I began to do some research regarding simple games to write in Javascript, however I began to get confused when it came to linking it all together.
							I looked at a simple puzzle from an image, a crossword puzzle, chess, checkers, tic-tac-toe, and I couldn't find what I was looking for. </p>
					<h2> Problems: </h2>
						<p>I had a hard time finding a code that made enough sense to me that I could break it down into pseudocode. After reading many different codes posted online and looking at the developer source, I decided to look for one of the most simple games I could think of; the Chrome Dino Jump.</p>
					<h2> Results: </h2>
						<p>I finally decided on trying to replicate the Chrome Dino Jump game. I copied and pasted the js, css, and html code into the correct folders, downloaded and renamed the images, but I had no luck on getting anything to show up.
							Hopefully looking at it more and better understanding Javascript and how everything links together, I will be able to sucessfully replicate the Dino Jump.</p>
