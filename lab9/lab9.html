        <h2>Challenges:</h2>
          <p>Working with JS within the console vs. Atom is a lot more confusing because you cannot see the errors as you go. You have to go back and edit after you save and test locally. </p>
        <h2>Problems:</h2>
          <p>Got the error message of "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'appendChild'of null at line _ . There was also a bit of difficulty finding the right id within the html and css for the project. We created a new id 'dream' to target the paragraph tag. We forgot to put the tag name before the style.color which caused another error message. Once that was fixed everything ran smoothly!"</p>
        <h2>Results:</h2>
          <p>Becky saved the day. She pointed out that when we were trying to fix the first error, we removed our "defer" within the link. When this was put in our website workied! </p>
